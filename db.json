      "description": "Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory leadership rival Boris Johnson not to be \"a coward\" about facing public scrutiny.\n\nMr Hunt said he was \"not interested\" in his private life but he should \"man up\" and debate with him on TV this week.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Johnson has warned the UK will face a \"democratic explosion\" if it does not leave the EU by 31 October.\n\nBut Mr Hunt challenged him to reveal whether he would call a general election if MPs refused to allow the UK to leave without a deal on that date.\n\nAfter Prime Minister Theresa May failed to get her Brexit deal through Parliament earlier this year, the date of the UK's departure for the EU was moved to 31 October.\n\n'Attacks'\nMr Johnson is under pressure to answer questions about a row with his partner in the early hours of Friday which led to police being called to his London home.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police has said it will not be taking any further action over the incident and his supporters have rallied around him. Former International Development Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Radio 4's Today programme a recording of the argument, given to the Guardian newspaper, was part of a \"politically-motivated series of attacks\".\n\n\"That is not the type of behaviour that you'd expect in our country, that's the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern bloc,\" she added.\n\nMr Johnson refused to answer questions about the incident at a hustings event on Saturday, instead insisting his stance on Brexit was what mattered to the public and to the Conservative Party members who will choose the next leader."

      "description": "At least 14 people were killed and more than 50 injured when heavy rain and strong winds caused a huge tent to collapse in the Indian state of Rajasthan on Sunday.\n\nSome were electrocuted by live wires as the tent caved in, and others killed by falling debris, Reuters reported.\n\nSome 300 people had gathered inside the tent for a religious event, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported.\n\nThe collapse took place in the Barmer district of the north-western state. The state's disaster management and relief minister Bhanwar Lal Meghwal questioned why organisers had not switched off the power supply in view of the wet weather.\n\nAn investigation has been launched into the incident.\n\nIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the incident \"unfortunate\" in a tweet on Sunday, saying his thoughts were \"with the bereaved families\"."

      "description": "A controversial fundraising page set up by sacked Australian rugby player Israel Folau has been shut down for promoting the exclusion of LGBT people, website GoFundMe says.\n\nFolau had his contract with Rugby Australia (RA) terminated in May after he said that \"hell awaits\" gay people.\n\nHe asked for public donations to help him with a legal fight against RA, arguing it dismissed him unlawfully.\n\nGoFundMe said the page violated its rules. All donations will be refunded.\n\n\"As a company, we are absolutely committed to the fight for equality for LGBTIQ+ people and fostering an environment of inclusivity,\" said spokeswoman Nicola Britton.\n\n\"While we welcome GoFundMe's engaging in diverse civil debate, we do not tolerate the promotion of discrimination or exclusion.\"\n\nFolau is a Christian who argues his contract termination was an act of religious discrimination.\n\nHe had received about A$760,000 (£414,000; $530,000) in donations since the page was set up last week, Australian media reported. RA terminated Folau's contract after saying he had breached behaviour standards \"including respectful use of social media\" by making anti-gay posts.\n\nEarlier this month, the star full-back filed a case against RA and Rugby New South Wales at the Fair Work Commission - Australia's national workplace relations tribunal."

When she woke up, she was freezing cold and still buckled into her seat, but the aircraft was parked.\n\nShe said she had experienced \"reoccurring night terrors\" since the incident took place.\n\nAir Canada has confirmed the incident occurred and is investigating.\n\nMs Adams said on Facebook that she woke up \"around midnight [a few hours after the flight landed] freezing cold still trapped in my seat in complete darkness.\"\n\nShe said the experience was \"terrifying\". Ms Adams managed to call her friend Deanna Dale to let her know where she was when her phone died less than a minute into the call.\n\nShe was unable to charge her phone as the plane had been shut down.\n\nMs Dale called Toronto Pearson Airport and told them of Ms Adams' whereabouts.\n\nWhile she was on board, Ms Adams managed to locate a torch in the cockpit of the plane and attempted to attract attention.\n\nShe was found by a luggage cart operator who she claimed was \"in shock\".\n\nMs Adams said that Air Canada staff offered her a limousine and a hotel but she declined, wanting to return home as quickly as possible.\n\nShe added that representatives from Air Canada had called her twice as part of the investigation and apologised."

She had followed her husband who had left months before on his brother's passport.\n\nSharrouf became notorious for graphic photographs he shared online from the warzone - including of his young children with weapons and one holding a severed head."

      "description": "England progressed to the quarter-finals of the Women's World Cup with a 3-0 victory over an enraged Cameroon side who protested after two VAR decisions went against them.\n\nGoals from Steph Houghton, Ellen White and Alex Greenwood sent England through to face Norway on Thursday, but the fractious game will be remembered for Cameroon's extraordinary reactions to White's goal and a disallowed effort from Ajara Nchout.\n\nThe distraught Cameroon players twice appeared unwilling to restart the match, gathering in a huddle after White's strike was given and remonstrating with the officials further after half-time.\n\nCaptain Houghton struck England's opener after an early backpass gave England an indirect free-kick, before the drama escalated.\n\nStriker White placed in England's second, which was initially ruled out before the video assistant referee deemed White to have been onside, but Cameroon reacted furiously and gestured to suggest the big screen's replays had indicated differently.\n\nThe African side thought they had pulled a goal back after the break through Nchout, but their despair increased when it was disallowed after a VAR review for an extremely tight offside call.\n\nEngland left-back Greenwood then swept in the Lionesses' third to secure a win that saw them reach at least the last eight of the competition for a fifth time, and for the fourth consecutive World Cup."

He denies the allegations.\n\nOrganisers say about 250,000 people attended the rally. The figure could not be verified.\n\nIt is said to be the largest protest since the fall of communism in 1989.\n\nWho was marching?\nThe protest was organised by the Million Moments for Democracy group. The movement has grown from a small student initiative into a mass movement. The prime minister is facing a criminal investigation in the Czech Republic for alleged abuse of €2m in EU subsidies over 10 years ago.\n\nPolice say they are investigating accusations that Mr Babis hid his ownership of a farm and conference centre known as \"Stork Nest\" (Capi hnizdo in Czech) so that it could qualify for an EU subsidy designed to help small businesses.\n\nThe billionaire is also the subject of an EU conflict-of-interest investigation over his Agrofert conglomerate, which he transferred to two trust funds shortly before he came to power in 2017."
